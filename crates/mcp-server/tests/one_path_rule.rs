//! One implementation of "is this path inside a declared root, or inside a hole in one".
//!
//! The rule used to live in three independent copies — the watcher's scope, the walk's
//! pruning, and the boot refusal — and they drifted apart twice in a row without any
//! test noticing: each copy is correct on the inputs its own tests use, and the failure
//! is a file that one of them follows while another does not. It now lives once, in
//! `project_model::PathScope`, and this gate is what keeps a fourth copy from appearing.
//!
//! Structural, not textual: the source is PARSED, so the word inside a doc comment or a
//! string does not count, and a copy written with `strip_prefix` counts just as much as
//! one written with `starts_with` — the precedent for that spelling is already in the
//! repository (`bsl-search/src/workspace_roots.rs::starts_at`).
//!
//! Test modules are skipped. A test may compare paths however it likes; the gate is
//! about what the daemon does.

         third of them, `an_armed_recursive_watch_reaches`, asks whether the watcher is \
         ALREADY holding a path, which the blind set and the re-watch both need and must \
         not answer differently. It cannot be PathScope: the root's side is the resolution \
         captured at watch time, and re-deriving it would claim coverage a retargeted \
         symlink has lost. The fourth, `an_arm_already_recorded_covers`, is not about \
         coverage at all: it asks whether one REGISTRATION lies inside another, which is \
         what decides whether un-watching the one takes the other with it, and it compares \
         the spellings the backend was given rather than where they lead. The subtree walk \
         computes no relative path any more — it keys each file by its own resolved \
         directory, the rule the workspace walk uses. The fifth, `restore_watches_beneath`, \
         asks which registrations an unwatch took with it, and the sixth asks the same of \
         one record before deciding whether a failed re-arm leaves it naming anything — \
         both about the spellings the backend was given and about nothing else. The \
         seventh sits beside the fourth: a record may be left out only for a path that lies \
         inside another registration BOTH ways — under its spelling, so the unwatch takes \
         it, and inside the tree it reaches, so the arm that follows puts it back",
