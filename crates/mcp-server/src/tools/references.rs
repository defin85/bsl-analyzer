//! Agent-facing `references` tool: every occurrence of ONE symbol, with what
//! each occurrence does at its site.
//!
//! Thin projection over [`ide::find_references_by_name`]. Every semantic
//! decision — which symbol an anchor names, whether it names more than one,
//! which occurrences count, and what kind each is — is taken in `ide`. This
//! module translates roots into file identities, projects places under the
//! location contract, applies the display limit and the output budget, and
//! assembles the envelope.
//!
//! The one thing it must never do is answer an empty list where the search
//! could not run: `outcome` carries that fact, and the whole tool exists
//! because a bare zero is what a client renames on.
